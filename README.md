# Math
Here are some of my math projects, neatly-typed in LaTeX code. <br> These were some of the most challenging problems given to first-year students. The topics (multivariable calculus, differential equations etc...) really pushed my comfort zone. <br> This was also the first time I learned and fell in love with LaTeX. <br> From here on out, I swore to do all my math in LaTeX :)
