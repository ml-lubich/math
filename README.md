# Math-Analytical-Projects
Here's some of my math and analytical projects I do when I'm not coding. I put in a lot of effort into them, spending many hours on Latex files, and exploring edge cases that may signify holes in my understanding. I got out what I put in. As a result, I got persistence and a passion for putting my best self into my work that I'm proud of for years to come.
