# Math-Analytical-Projects
Here's some of my math and analytical projects I do when I'm not coding. I put in a lot of effort into them, spending many hours on LaTeX code, and exploring edge cases that may signify holes in my understanding. I got out what I put in. 

As a result, I got persistence and a passion for putting my best self into my work. 

I'm always looking for feedack; if you have any, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for taking a look and have a good day!
